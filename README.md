# Video Player tech test
Video Player built in React. 


## Known bugs and issues
Long if statement to keep the description in place within the window, I realize there must be a more efficient and secure way to handle this. 

Accessibility is far from perfect, would need to update to better semantic use of divs/buttons.

I made the style for custom video controls but could not get the functionality to work properly when updating to play a new video file.
Something to do with how React renders and updates components when a state or prop changes.
