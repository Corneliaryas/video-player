# Video Player tech test
Video Player built in React. 


## Known bugs and issues
Aspect-ratio not supported in firefox.

Http requests (like the video-urls) not supported in google chrome, needs to be https.

Long if statement to keep the description in place within the window, I realize there must be a more efficient and secure way to handle this. 

Accessibility is far from perfect, would need to update to better semantic use of divs/buttons.
