# Video Player tech test
Video Player built in React. 


## Known bugs and issues
Aspect-ratio not supported in firefox.

Http requests (like the video-urls) not supported in google chrome, needs to be https.

Long if statement to keep the description in place within the window, I realize there must be a more efficient and secure way to handle this. 

Accessibility is far from perfect, would need to update to better semantic use of divs/buttons.

I made the style and basic funtionality for custom video controls but could not get the functionality to work properly when updating to play a new video file.
Something to do with how React renders and updates components when a state or prop changes.
